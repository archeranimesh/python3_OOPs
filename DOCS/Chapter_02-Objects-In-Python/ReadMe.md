# Chapter 02 | Objects in Python #

## Hello World Python Classes ##

````python
class MyFirstClass:
    pass

# initiate the class
a = MyFirstClass()
b = MyFirstClass()
````

* The above is a most basic class in python.
* `class` : keyword defines the start of class.
* Class names follows a conventions in Python.
    - Class name should comprise of number, letters or underscore.
    - Class name should use CamelCase naming convention.
    - The first letter of a class name should be capital, as when creating object we can differentiate between a function call or Object initialization.
* Object Creation:-
    - We can create the objects of a new class as shown in the code above.
    - The only difference in creating object and calling function is that, creating function has the first character as capitalized.
* `python -i hello.py` : runs the code, and then enters into python shell loading the class.
